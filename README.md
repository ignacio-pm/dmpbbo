# Forked repository dmpbbo

This repository is a forked repository from [dmpbbo](https://github.com/stulp/dmpbbo) and is used as a submodule of the repository [franka_tool_handover](https://github.com/ignacio-pm/franka_tool_handover).

The main branch has modifications for a handover experiment between two robots. For the general use, we recommend using the original repository or the branch [master](https://github.com/ignacio-pm/dmpbbo/tree/master). The branch master also contains the explanation of the installation and the use of the repository. The integration of this module into the project franka_tool_handover it is explained in its repository.

The main branch demo_robot is used for a giver robot in a robot-to-human handover or a robot-to-robot handover. Meanwhile, the branch [demo_receiver](https://github.com/ignacio-pm/dmpbbo/tree/demo_receiver) is optimized for the receiver robot. The branch [2_Robots](https://github.com/ignacio-pm/dmpbbo/tree/2_Robots) uses two robots in the same computer or ROS Environment. Its functionality should work but the whole algorithm does not working due to the implementation of the main repository [franka_tool_handover](https://github.com/ignacio-pm/franka_tool_handover).


All other branches are from the original repository.
